                <h1>Philippine Opera</h1>
                <p>The emergence of the Filipino opera started to take shape during the middle part of the 19th century. Foreign performers, including instrumental virtuosi, as well as opera singers and Spanish zarzuela performers came to the country to perform for enthusiastic audiences.</p>
                <p>The opera is an art and music form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and a musical score, usually in an elaborate theatrical setting. It incorporates many of the elements of spoken theater, such as acting, scenery, costumes, and sometimes includes dance.</p>
                <p>The performance is typically given in an opera house, cultural center, theater, or auditorium. It is accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble. The dialogue is entirely sung and not spoken.</p>
                <p>Opera is part of the Western classical music form and tradition. It started in Italy in the 16th century and soon spread through the rest of Europe. While English, French, Italian operas were being presented, it was the Italian opera that captured the creative imagination of composers, librettists and singers alike.</p>

                <h1>Local Theaters and Early Philippine Operas</h1>
                <p>Local theaters, including the Zorilla, Principe Alfonso, Variedades, Quiapo and Tondo Theaters, were the choice venues for the mainly Italian operas that came to the country, such as Lucia di Lammermoor, La Boheme, La Traviata, and Aida. Later, other opera venues were established, led by the Manila Grand Opera House and the Metropolitan Theater (Met).</p>
                <p>Sandugong Panaginip is the first Filipino opera by Pedro Paterno, a poet, novelist, musician, and government official. This was first presented at the Zorilla Theater on August 2, 1902.</p>
                <p>The Orchestra Molina was known for their interpretation of operatic works as well as other classical Compositions.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) by then First Lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos in 1969 paved the way for other Filipino operas to be staged at a legitimate venue of international standard.</p>

                <p>Felipe Padilla de Leon- a National artist who composed the Operas based on Rizal's two novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. These were presented at the CCP Main Theater in 1970 and 1975, respectively.</p>
                <p>Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were later restaged also at CCP as musical plays with new music composed by Ryan Cayabyab and new creative team.</p>
                <h3>NOLI ME TANGERE, THE OPERA</h3>
                <p>The three-act opera Noli Me Tangere was composed by National Artist Felipe Padilla de Leon, with libretto by National Artist Guillermo Tolentino. It premiered in 1957 at the FEU Auditorium. The cast included Juanita Javier Torres as Maria Clara, Don David as Ibarra, Fides Cuyugan Asensio as Sisa, Milo Cristobal as Padre (Father/priest) Damaso, and Morli Daram as the director.</p>

                <h1>La Loba Negra</h1>
                <p>La Loba Negra (The Black She-Wolf) is a three-act Filipino opera. Acts I and II are based on history. Act III is based on a legend attributed to Fr. Jose Burgos. He was one of the three martyred priests, Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora who were executed in Bagumbayan (now Luneta) in 1872. The music was composed by National Artist Francisco Feliciano, with libretto by soprano Fides Cuyugan Asensio.</p>
                <h3>Background of the Opera</h3>
                <p>The story of La Loba Negra takes place during the 17th century of Spanish rule in the Philippines. It revolves around the tragic assassination of Spanish Governor-General Bustamante. His administration was greatly admired for his planned reforms in the colonial administration. It also focused on the bitter reaction and planned vendetta (revenge) by his wife Doña Luisa (La Loba Negra) on the religious perpetrators. As massive corruption and friar abuse were prevalent, the entry of Governor-General Bustamante to institute reforms did not sit well with the powerfully abusive priests, which led to his untimely death.</p>
